# Human To-Do List

Tasks that require human action — account creation, API keys, billing, etc.
Claude cannot do these. Check them off as you go.

---

## Accounts to Create

- [x] **Railway** ✅ — backend hosting (free tier)
- [x] **Vercel** ✅ — frontend hosting (free tier)

---

## API Keys to Obtain

- [x] **CTA Train Tracker API key** ✅
- [x] **CTA Bus Tracker API key** ✅
- [x] **Anthropic API key** ✅
- [x] **Google Maps API key** ✅
- [x] Also add to Railway dashboard env vars (Settings → Variables) before deploying

---

## Phase 6 — Deployment (do after accounts above are ready)

- [x] Deploy backend to Railway (see step-by-step in `cta_app_handoff_prompt.md`)
- [x] Set environment variables in Railway dashboard:
  - `CTA_TRAIN_API_KEY`
  - `CTA_BUS_API_KEY`
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  - `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` ← required for address/landmark geocoding
  - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` ← fill in after Vercel URL is known
- [x] Deploy frontend to Vercel (see step-by-step in `cta_app_handoff_prompt.md`)
- [x] Set `VITE_BACKEND_URL` in Vercel dashboard → your Railway URL
- [x] Go back to Railway and set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` → your Vercel URL, then redeploy
- [x] Update `frontend/.env.production` with the real Railway URL and commit
- [x] Test the live app end-to-end on the public URLs
- [ ] (Optional) Add a custom domain in Vercel dashboard → Settings → Domains --Maybe something like "Chicago Routefinder"

## Map UI — Post-Launch Checks

- [ ] **Confirm desktop split-panel width ratio** — currently set to 40% route cards / 60% map. Check this on a real desktop screen before deployment and adjust if needed.

- [ ] **Confirm mobile minimum heights** — currently set to route card panel min-height: 300px, map min-height: 350px. Test on a real mobile device before deployment and adjust if needed.

- [ ] **Source and provide transit location photos** (see [BUG-007 in BUGS_TO_BE_FIXED.md](BUGS_TO_BE_FIXED.md)) — at least 10 photos needed for the loading/no-routes map panel. Decide on sourcing approach:
  - Option A: Take your own photos at CTA locations
  - Option B: Free stock photos from Unsplash or Wikimedia Commons (verify license per image)
  - Option C: Combination of both
  - Each photo needs a location name caption (e.g. "Addison · Red Line", "O'Hare · Blue Line", "95th/Dan Ryan · Red Line")
  - Once sourced, place images in `frontend/public/transit-photos/` and give Claude the list of filenames + captions to wire up

## Phase 7 — Monetization (future)

**Strategy:** House ads first (Phase 1) — no third-party ad scripts. Defer EthicalAds/Carbon Ads until the user base is established. Google AdSense deliberately avoided for now (auto-placed display ads are likely to clash with The Chicago Routefinder editorial design).

- [ ] Sign up for Amazon Associates (or a comparable affiliate program) to generate affiliate links for the house ad product list — see `FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLANS.md` → Feature Monetization → Affiliate Products Reference
- [ ] Set `VITE_HOUSE_AD_ENABLED=true`, `VITE_HOUSE_AD_URL`, and `VITE_HOUSE_AD_TEXT` in the Vercel dashboard after Claude wires up the AdSlot component
- [ ] After reaching meaningful traffic, evaluate EthicalAds (ethicalads.io) or Carbon Ads (carbonads.com) — both require applying with a live site and have traffic/content requirements
---

## Post-Deployment Cleanup

- [x] **Restore street-network walking graph (Feature K)** ✅ — Completed. `street_graph.graphml` uploaded as a GitHub Release asset; Dockerfile curl block re-enabled and pointed at the GitHub API asset endpoint. Street-routed walking is live in production.
- [ ] **Remove geocoding rate limit** — `backend/gtfs_loader.py` has a temporary 9,500 calls/month cap (`_GEOCODE_CALL_LIMIT`) to prevent accidental charges during testing. Once the app is live and call volume is understood, remove the cap: delete `_GEOCODE_CALL_LIMIT`, `_GEOCODE_COUNTER_PATH`, `_geocode_call_counter`, `_load_geocode_counter`, `_save_geocode_counter`, `_geocode_call_count`, `_increment_geocode_call_count`, and the guard block inside `geocode_google`. The large comment block above `_GEOCODE_CALL_LIMIT` marks all of these.

## Ongoing Maintenance

- [ ] **GTFS data** — CTA updates its static feed periodically. Railway re-downloads it on every deploy, but if you go weeks without deploying, restart the Railway service manually to pull fresh data.
- [ ] **Monitor Anthropic API costs** — check console.anthropic.com/usage monthly, especially after any public launch push
- [ ] **CTA API keys** — both are free but may require periodic renewal; check transitchicago.com if API calls start failing
